# SQL-challenge

Within this repo, you will find two .sql files, a schema, and an example of various SQL statements to put various data from the database. An ERD is also available and shows the relationships between the various tables. 

While exploring the data, I did note that many employees have been listed within multiple departments. While this is not abnormal, it may be worth adding a date range to the dept_emp table that indicates the starting and ending dates that an employee was/is within each department or a primary department field for these employees.

The employee's table contains all the necessary information for this exercise. However, in an active organization, I would also add a column for each employee's pro-nouns and not just sex. Items that could be added at hiring would be personal preferences regarding birthday announcements (private/public). If personal preferences of that nature are documented a separate table would be recommended.
